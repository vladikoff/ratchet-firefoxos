The docs may also be run locally.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).\n2. From the root `/ratchet/docs` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.\n3. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and boom!\n\nLearn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).\n\n## Support\n\nQuestions or discussions about Ratchet should happen in the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goratchet) or hit us up on Twitter [@GoRatchet](https://twitter.com/goratchet).\n\n## Reporting bugs & contributing\n\nPlease file a GitHub issue to [report a bug](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet/issues). When reporting a bug, be sure to follow the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/ratchet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nA small list of \"gotchas\" are provided below for designers and developers starting to work with Ratchet\n\n- Ratchet is designed to respond to touch events from a mobile device. In order to use mouse click events (for desktop browsing and testing), you have a few options:\n    - Enable touch event emulation in Chrome (found in the overrides tab in the web inspector preferences)\n    - Use a javascript library like fingerblast.js to emulate touch events (ideally only loaded from desktop devices)\n- Script tags containing javascript will not be executed on pages that are loaded with push.js. If you would like to attach event handlers to elements on other pages, document-level event delegation is a common solution.\n- Ratchet uses XHR requests to fetch additional pages inside the application. Due to security concerns, modern browsers prevent XHR requests when opening files locally (aka using the file:/// protocol); consequently, Ratchet does not work when opened directly as a file.\n    - A common solution to this is to simply serve the files from a local server. One convenient way to achieve this is to run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>``` to serve up the files in the current directory to ```http://localhost:<port>```\n\n## Maintainer\n\nConnor Sears\n\n- <https://twitter.com/connors>\n- <https://github.com/connors>\n\n\n\nCreated by Connor Sears, Dave Gamache, and Jacob Thornton\n\n\n## License\n\nRatchet is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n",
